const manassasFAQs = [
  {
    q: "Do you build decks in Old Town Manassas or Wellington?",
    a: "Yes. We work across the City of Manassas footprint including Old Town, Wellington, Wellington Estates, Ashleigh and the Sudley Springs corridor. Old Town builds run through the Architectural Review Board for any visible-from-street modifications, and we prepare the elevation drawings and material specs the ARB expects."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the Prince William County deck permit process take?",
    a: "Prince William County Department of Development Services is currently the fastest jurisdiction in Northern Virginia for deck plan review, typically 2 to 3 weeks for a standard residential submission. The City of Manassas runs slightly longer when the property sits inside the Old Town historic overlay because of the architectural review step."
  },
  {
    q: "What's the typical cost for a composite deck in Manassas?",
    a: "Most Manassas projects land between $18,000 and $35,000 for a 300 to 450 sqft Trex Enhance or Transcend build with aluminum railings. Pricing in Prince William County typically runs 10 to 15 percent below comparable builds in Loudoun or Fairfax due to lower lot acquisition costs feeding into local trade rates."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you handle HOA approvals in Wellington or Bull Run Mountain Estates?",
    a: "Yes. We've submitted to Wellington HOA, Bull Run Mountain Estates and the smaller Stonewall Heights association. We provide the stamped CAD drawings, material color samples and setback diagrams these boards require, and we follow each submission through approval before we break ground."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you replace old wood decks in Manassas's older neighborhoods?",
    a: "Frequently. Many Sudley Springs and Stonewall Heights homes still have pressure-treated decks from the late 80s and 90s where the joists, ledger board or footings have failed. We assess whether a full structural rebuild or a resurface over sound framing is the right call before quoting."
  },
  {
    q: "Will composite decking hold up in Manassas's climate?",
    a: "Yes. Trex and TimberTech AZEK are engineered for the freeze-thaw cycles and humid summers we see in Prince William County. Capped composite resists the surface mildew that destroys uncapped boards on shaded Bull Run lots, and the boards won't cup or splinter the way pressure-treated pine does after five Manassas summers."

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>Custom Deck Builder Serving Manassas Homeowners</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Manassas is one of the more architecturally diverse pockets of Northern Virginia. Inside the city limits you have Old Town blocks where the streetscape hasn't changed much since the early 1900s, and ten minutes north you're in Wellington and Ashleigh where the homes were stamped out in the 90s and early 2000s. Building a deck here means knowing the difference between a corner-lot Victorian that needs Architectural Review Board approval and a colonial in Wellington Estates where the HOA already has a stock approved color palette.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>We've built across all of it. Loudoun Decks runs a Manassas-based crew that knows Prince William County's plan reviewers by name, and we structure our scopes to match what local homeowners actually need: a clean, durable deck that respects the home's age and architecture without pricing the owner out of the project. Manassas project pricing typically lands 10 to 15 percent below comparable Loudoun and Fairfax builds, and that gap has nothing to do with quality. It's lot economics, trade rates and overhead.</p>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>Trex and TimberTech Composite Decks in Manassas</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>The vast majority of new builds we install in Prince William County are capped composite. Trex Enhance Naturals is the volume choice for Wellington, Ashleigh and Stonewall Heights homeowners who want a 25-year fade and stain warranty without pushing the budget past $25,000 on a 350 sqft footprint. When clients want the deeper grain pattern and the heavier board feel, we step them up to Trex Transcend in Spiced Rum or Lava Rock, or to TimberTech AZEK Vintage on Old Town historic projects where the visual match to the existing trim matters.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Composite is the right call for Manassas's climate. Bull Run watershed humidity, the freeze-thaw cycles in January, and the heavy summer pollen drops from the oaks around Sudley Springs all chew through pressure-treated wood inside a decade. Capped composite ignores all of it. We use hidden fasteners on every Trex install, breathable flashing tape at the ledger, and stainless lag connections rated for the loads our engineer specs into the structural drawings.</p>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>Deck Replacement and Resurfacing in Manassas, VA</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>A surprising number of Stonewall Heights and Sudley Springs homes still have their original pressure-treated decks from the late 80s. By the time a homeowner calls us, the surface boards are usually splintering, the railings are loose, and the joists may or may not be salvageable. Our first step is always a structural inspection. If the framing is sound, footings are intact, and the ledger is properly flashed, we can resurface with composite for $10,000 to $18,000 and give you a deck that performs like new.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>If the framing is rotted, the ledger was nailed instead of bolted, or the footings have shifted, resurfacing isn't safe. We tear down and rebuild from new footings up. Full replacement on a 350 sqft Manassas project typically runs $22,000 to $30,000 depending on board selection and railing system. We'll tell you which path is appropriate before we quote, with photos.</p>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>Why Homeowners in Manassas Choose Loudoun Decks</h2>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.25rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.6rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Three-jurisdiction fluency.</strong> City of Manassas, Manassas Park and unincorporated Prince William County each have their own building departments and plan reviewers. We've worked with all three.</li>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.6rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Historic district experience.</strong> Old Town Architectural Review submissions require elevation drawings, material samples and exterior color justification. We've successfully shepherded these through the process.</li>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.6rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Trex Certified installer.</strong> Our crews train annually on Trex Enhance, Transcend and Signature systems plus the full TimberTech AZEK line.</li>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.6rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Honest pricing for the local market.</strong> Manassas projects don't carry Loudoun overhead. Our quotes reflect that, and we'll show you the line items.</li>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.6rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>5-Star Google Rated.</strong> Our reputation in Prince William County is built one finished deck at a time, and we'd rather walk away than rush a rebuild.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>Permits, HOA and Planning Support in Manassas</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Prince William County Department of Development Services handles plan review for the unincorporated areas surrounding the city, and they're currently the fastest deck-permitting jurisdiction in Northern Virginia at roughly 2 to 3 weeks turnaround. Our submissions include sealed structural drawings, ledger attachment details, footing depths, and the full setback analysis their reviewers expect on the first round.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Inside the City of Manassas the building department runs a similar timeline, but Old Town addresses inside the historic overlay add an Architectural Review Board step. The ARB looks at deck visibility from the street, railing style, and material color, especially on corner lots and rear decks that read from public right of way. We prepare the ARB packet alongside the building permit so the two reviews run in parallel where possible.</p>

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>Recent Deck Projects Near Manassas</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2.5rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Typical Manassas projects we help with include 350 to 450 sqft Trex Enhance Naturals decks for Wellington and Ashleigh homeowners replacing 20-year-old pressure-treated structures, screened porch additions on Bull Run wooded lots where mosquitos make April-through-October use unpleasant otherwise, and compact two-level walkout decks for Sudley Springs homes built into hillside grade. In Old Town we've also handled smaller historic-district rebuilds where the deck has to read as period-appropriate from the street while delivering modern composite performance behind the railing.</p>
