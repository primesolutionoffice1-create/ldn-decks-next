    { "@type": "Question", name: "What is the best deck material for Virginia's climate?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Composite decking (Trex, TimberTech) is the best overall choice for Virginia's climate. It handles the freeze-thaw cycles, summer humidity, and UV exposure without the constant maintenance that wood requires. For premium builds, AZEK PVC is virtually impervious to moisture. For budget builds, pressure-treated pine works if you commit to annual maintenance." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How much does each deck material cost per square foot?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Installed prices in Northern Virginia: pressure-treated pine $18-$28/sqft, cedar $25-$38/sqft, Trex Enhance $30-$48/sqft, Trex Transcend $45-$65/sqft, TimberTech AZEK $50-$75/sqft, IPE hardwood $55-$80/sqft, and aluminum decking $40-$65/sqft." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Is composite decking worth the extra cost over wood?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes for most homeowners. Composite costs 40-60% more upfront but requires zero staining, sealing, or board replacement. Over 15 years, composite actually costs less than wood when you factor in $300-$800/year in maintenance. Composite also lasts 25-50 years versus 10-15 for pressure-treated wood." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "What is the longest-lasting deck material?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "AZEK PVC decking and IPE hardwood both last 50+ years with proper care. AZEK requires almost zero maintenance while IPE needs annual oiling. Among composites, Trex Lineage and TimberTech AZEK carry 50-year warranties. Aluminum decking can last 50+ years but is uncommon in residential applications." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Does composite decking get hot in the sun?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes, composite decking gets hotter than wood in direct sun — typically 20-40°F above ambient temperature. Lighter colors stay cooler. AZEK PVC runs slightly cooler than wood-plastic composites. For pool surrounds or full-sun decks, choose lighter colors or consider AZEK's cooler-touch technology." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "What deck material is best for a pool deck?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "AZEK PVC decking is the best pool deck material because it contains zero wood content, resists moisture and pool chemicals, and won't splinter. Trex composite also works well but the PVC core of AZEK makes it superior for constant water exposure. Avoid untreated wood near pools — it warps, splinters, and harbors algae." } },

          <p><strong>Composite decking wins for most Northern Virginia homeowners</strong> &mdash; it balances cost, lifespan, and zero maintenance better than any other option. If budget is the top priority, pressure-treated pine at <strong>$18&ndash;$28/sqft</strong> installed gets you a functional deck. If longevity and premium aesthetics matter most, <strong>TimberTech AZEK ($50&ndash;$75/sqft)</strong> or <strong>Trex Lineage ($50&ndash;$65/sqft)</strong> deliver 50-year performance. <a href="tel:+15716557207" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>Call (571) 655-7207</a> for material recommendations tailored to your project.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 1: Intro ===== */}
          <p style={S.p}>Choosing a deck material is the most important decision in your entire project. It determines your upfront cost, ongoing maintenance burden, how long the deck lasts, how it handles Virginia&apos;s freeze-thaw cycles and humid summers, and how much value it adds to your home. Get this decision right and you&apos;ll enjoy your deck for decades. Get it wrong and you&apos;re staining, replacing boards, or rebuilding within 10 years.</p>
          <p style={S.p}>This guide compares every deck material available in the Northern Virginia market in 2026 &mdash; from budget-friendly pressure-treated pine to ultra-premium IPE hardwood and even aluminum decking. We install all of these materials and have direct experience with how each one performs in Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William County conditions.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 3: Pressure-Treated Pine ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Pressure-Treated Pine: The Budget Standard</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Pressure-treated (PT) pine is the most common deck material in America and the default &ldquo;builder grade&rdquo; option. It&apos;s significantly less expensive than every other option on this list, which is both its greatest strength and the reason many homeowners eventually wish they&apos;d spent more upfront.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Pros</h3>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
            <li>Lowest upfront cost: $18&ndash;$28/sqft installed</li>
            <li>Widely available at every lumber yard</li>
            <li>Can be stained any color</li>
            <li>Easy to repair (individual board replacement is simple)</li>
            <li>Stays cooler underfoot than composite in direct sun</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Cons</h3>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
            <li>Requires staining/sealing every 1&ndash;2 years ($300&ndash;$800/year)</li>
            <li>Splinters, warps, and cracks over time</li>
            <li>Susceptible to rot, especially in Virginia&apos;s humidity</li>
            <li>10&ndash;15 year realistic lifespan</li>
            <li>No manufacturer warranty on the finished product</li>
            <li>Lower resale value (buyers discount for maintenance needs)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Virginia Performance</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>PT pine handles Virginia winters well (it doesn&apos;t crack from freezing), but the humid summers are punishing. Moisture absorption leads to swelling, cupping, and accelerated rot &mdash; particularly where boards trap water against joists. Without diligent annual maintenance, expect visible deterioration by year 5&ndash;7 and potential structural concerns by year 10&ndash;12.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 4: Cedar & Redwood ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Cedar and Redwood: Natural Beauty, Natural Cost</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Cedar and redwood are the premium natural wood options. Both contain natural oils that resist rot and insects better than pine, and both deliver a warm, rich appearance that many homeowners love. However, they come at 40&ndash;60% more than PT pine and still require regular maintenance.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Cedar ($25&ndash;$38/sqft installed)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Western red cedar is the most popular natural wood upgrade in Northern Virginia. Its tight grain and warm reddish-brown color look beautiful when freshly stained. Cedar is naturally resistant to rot and insects thanks to its oil content, and it&apos;s lighter than PT pine (easier to handle during installation). The downside: cedar is softer than pine and dents/scratches more easily, and it grays rapidly without UV-protective stain. Expect to stain every 1&ndash;2 years to maintain color. Lifespan with maintenance: 15&ndash;20 years.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Redwood ($30&ndash;$45/sqft installed)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Redwood is denser and more durable than cedar with superior natural rot resistance. It&apos;s also increasingly expensive and harder to source on the East Coast (most redwood is harvested in California). The aesthetic is undeniably gorgeous, but at $30&ndash;$45/sqft installed, you&apos;re approaching Trex Transcend pricing without any warranty or maintenance advantage. For most Virginia homeowners, composite makes more financial sense at this price point.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 5: Trex Composite ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Trex Composite: Our Most-Installed Material</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Trex is the world&apos;s largest composite decking manufacturer and the brand we install more than any other. As a <strong>Trex Platinum Partner</strong> (top 1% of installers nationally), we have deep experience with every product line.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Trex Enhance ($30&ndash;$48/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>The entry point into composite. Basics offers solid colors; Naturals adds multi-tonal wood grain. Both carry 25-year warranties. Best for homeowners who want composite durability at the closest price to wood. The aesthetic gap between Enhance and Transcend has narrowed significantly in recent years.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Trex Transcend ($45&ndash;$60/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Our most-installed product. Deeper wood grain, thicker protective shell, and a color palette (Havana Gold, Spiced Rum, Island Mist, Lava Rock) designed to complement Virginia&apos;s red brick and stone architecture. 25-year warranty. This is the sweet spot for most Northern Virginia homeowners.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Trex Lineage ($50&ndash;$65/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Launched in 2024, Lineage features the most realistic wood grain in composite decking. Backed by a 50-year warranty. The premium over Transcend is 10&ndash;15%, which is well worth it for homeowners who want the absolute best Trex appearance with half-century coverage. For a full Trex lineup review, see our <Link href="/trex-transcend-review-northern-virginia" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>Trex Transcend review</Link>.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 6: TimberTech/AZEK ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>TimberTech and AZEK: Premium Composite and PVC</h2>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>TimberTech Pro and Edge ($40&ndash;$60/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Direct competitor to Trex Transcend. TimberTech&apos;s polymer cap is approximately 35% thicker, which some contractors argue provides better long-term scratch resistance. The Edge Prime+ line features a distinctive 5.5&rdquo; wide plank. 30-year warranty. Excellent choice for homeowners who want a slight edge in durability over standard composite.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>TimberTech AZEK ($50&ndash;$75/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Full PVC decking with zero wood content. AZEK boards will not absorb moisture, swell, or rot &mdash; ever. The 50-year warranty reflects this durability. AZEK stays slightly cooler than wood-plastic composite and is virtually impervious to pool chemicals, making it the top choice for pool decks and waterfront properties. The Vintage collection (Mahogany, English Walnut, Coastline) delivers the deepest color saturation in the industry. For a full comparison, see our <Link href="/trex-vs-timbertech-vs-azek" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>Trex vs TimberTech vs AZEK guide</Link>.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 7: Fiberon ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Fiberon: The Value Composite</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Fiberon is the third-largest composite manufacturer and offers competitive products at price points slightly below Trex and TimberTech.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Fiberon Good Life ($30&ndash;$42/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Comparable to Trex Enhance with a 25-year warranty. Solid entry-level composite choice. Limited color palette compared to Trex.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Fiberon Concordia ($40&ndash;$55/sqft)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Mid-range option competing with Trex Transcend. Good aesthetics and durability, though the wood grain realism doesn&apos;t quite match Transcend or Lineage. 25-year warranty. Fiberon is a solid choice for cost-conscious homeowners who want composite performance at 10&ndash;15% below the top brands.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 8: IPE Hardwood ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>IPE Hardwood: The Exotic Luxury Option</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>IPE (pronounced &ldquo;EE-pay&rdquo;) is a South American tropical hardwood that&apos;s among the hardest and most durable natural woods in the world. Janka hardness of 3,680 (vs 870 for PT pine). It&apos;s the Rolls Royce of deck materials.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Pros</h3>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
            <li>Extraordinary natural beauty &mdash; deep chocolate-brown color</li>
            <li>50+ year lifespan (some IPE decks have lasted 75+ years)</li>
            <li>Naturally fire-resistant (Class A rating)</li>
            <li>Extremely hard &mdash; resists scratches, dents, and wear</li>
            <li>Cooler underfoot than composite</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Cons</h3>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
            <li>$55&ndash;$80/sqft installed (highest material cost)</li>
            <li>Requires annual oiling to maintain color (will silver otherwise)</li>
            <li>Extremely dense &mdash; requires pre-drilling every screw hole</li>
            <li>Heavier than any other option (structural considerations)</li>
            <li>Environmental concerns (tropical deforestation)</li>
            <li>Limited/no manufacturer warranty</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={S.p}>IPE is best suited for ultra-luxury homes in Great Falls, McLean, and Vienna where the homeowner prioritizes natural materials above all else and is willing to invest in annual maintenance. For most homeowners, AZEK or Trex Lineage delivers comparable longevity with far less maintenance at a similar or lower price.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 9: Aluminum Decking ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Aluminum Decking: The Emerging Trend</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Aluminum decking is relatively new to the residential market and is worth mentioning for specific applications. Brands like Wahoo Decks and LockDry offer interlocking aluminum plank systems that are completely waterproof, fireproof, and virtually indestructible.</p>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Pros</h3>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
            <li>100% waterproof &mdash; creates a dry space underneath</li>
            <li>Fireproof (important near grills or fire pits)</li>
            <li>Will not rot, warp, crack, or fade</li>
            <li>50+ year lifespan with zero maintenance</li>
            <li>Lightweight (easier on substructure)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style={S.h3}>Cons</h3>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
            <li>Gets very hot in direct sun (hotter than composite)</li>
            <li>Industrial appearance &mdash; doesn&apos;t look like wood</li>
            <li>$40&ndash;$65/sqft installed</li>
            <li>Limited color options</li>
            <li>Can be noisy in rain</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={S.p}>Aluminum decking makes the most sense for elevated decks where creating a dry patio underneath is a priority, or for commercial applications. For residential aesthetics in Northern Virginia, composite and PVC remain dominant.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 10: PVC vs Composite ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>PVC Decking vs. Composite: What&apos;s the Difference?</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>This is one of the most common questions we hear, and the confusion is understandable. Here is the key distinction:</p>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem', lineHeight: 2 }}>
            <li><strong>Composite decking</strong> (Trex, TimberTech Pro, Fiberon) has a <strong>wood-plastic composite core</strong> &mdash; recycled wood fibers blended with plastic polymers, wrapped in a protective polymer shell.</li>
            <li><strong>PVC decking</strong> (AZEK, TimberTech AZEK) is <strong>100% synthetic polymer</strong> &mdash; no wood content at all. The entire board, core to surface, is engineered plastic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={S.p}>The practical difference: PVC is completely impervious to moisture (wood-plastic composite can absorb minimal moisture through cut ends), lighter, and slightly more expensive. For most residential applications, composite is excellent. For pool decks, docks, and extreme moisture exposure, PVC has an edge.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 11: Which Material Is Right for You ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Which Material Is Right for You? Decision Guide</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Rather than a one-size-fits-all recommendation, here is how to match the right material to your specific situation:</p>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem', lineHeight: 2.2 }}>

          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Virginia Climate Considerations</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Northern Virginia&apos;s climate presents specific challenges that should influence your material choice:</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Freeze-Thaw Cycles</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Northern Virginia experiences 80&ndash;100 freeze-thaw cycles per winter. Water trapped in wood fibers expands when frozen, causing cracking and splitting. This is the primary reason wood decks deteriorate faster here than in stable warm climates. Composite and PVC boards handle freeze-thaw without structural concern.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Summer Humidity</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Average relative humidity of 70%+ from June through September creates ideal conditions for mold and mildew growth on organic materials. Wood decks in shaded areas are particularly vulnerable. Composite&apos;s protective shell resists mold growth; PVC is virtually immune.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>UV Exposure</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>1,800&ndash;2,000 hours of direct sunlight annually fade unprotected wood within 6&ndash;12 months. Cedar turns gray; PT pine turns gray and develops surface checks. Composite and PVC shells are engineered with UV stabilizers that maintain color for 25&ndash;50 years within warranted limits.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Snow and Ice</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Northern Virginia averages 15&ndash;20 inches of snow annually. Composite and PVC boards shed snow and ice more easily than textured wood. Never use rock salt on any deck material &mdash; use calcium chloride or sand instead. Aluminum decking handles de-icing chemicals best of all materials.</p>

          {[
            { q: "What is the best deck material for Virginia's climate?", a: "Composite decking (Trex, TimberTech) is the best overall choice. It handles freeze-thaw cycles, humidity, and UV exposure without constant maintenance. For premium builds, AZEK PVC is virtually impervious to moisture. For budgets, pressure-treated pine works with annual maintenance commitment." },
            { q: "How much does each deck material cost per square foot?", a: "Installed in Northern Virginia: pressure-treated $18-$28, cedar $25-$38, Trex Enhance $30-$48, Trex Transcend $45-$65, TimberTech AZEK $50-$75, IPE $55-$80, aluminum $40-$65 per square foot." },
            { q: "Is composite decking worth the extra cost over wood?", a: "Yes. Over 15 years, composite costs less than wood when factoring $300-$800/year in maintenance. Composite lasts 25-50 years vs 10-15 for wood and recoups 65-80% at resale vs 50-60% for wood." },
            { q: "What is the longest-lasting deck material?", a: "AZEK PVC and IPE hardwood both last 50+ years. Among composites, Trex Lineage and TimberTech AZEK carry 50-year warranties. Aluminum can last 50+ years but isn't common in residential applications." },
            { q: "Does composite decking get hot in the sun?", a: "Yes, 20-40°F above ambient in direct sun. Lighter colors stay cooler. AZEK PVC runs slightly cooler than wood-plastic composites. For full-sun decks, choose lighter colors or AZEK's cooler-touch technology." },
            { q: "What deck material is best for a pool deck?", a: "AZEK PVC — zero wood content, moisture-proof, chemical-resistant, and splinter-free. Trex composite also works well. Avoid untreated wood near pools — it warps, splinters, and harbors algae." },
