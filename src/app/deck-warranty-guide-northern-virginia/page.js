          {/* ===== SECTION 1: Why Warranties Matter ===== */}
          <p style={S.p}>A new deck in Northern Virginia represents a $15,000&ndash;$60,000+ investment. At that price point, warranty coverage isn&apos;t an afterthought &mdash; it&apos;s a deciding factor. Yet most homeowners sign contracts without fully understanding what their warranty actually covers, what voids it, and who is responsible when something goes wrong five years down the road.</p>
          <p style={S.p}>This guide breaks down every warranty layer that protects (or fails to protect) your deck: manufacturer product warranties, installer workmanship guarantees, and the critical role that installer certification plays in keeping your coverage intact. We&apos;ll also cover how to file a claim, the difference between warranty and insurance, and the specific warranty pitfalls we see most often in Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William counties.</p>
          <p style={S.p}>Whether you&apos;re comparing quotes, evaluating contractors, or dealing with a deck issue years after installation, this guide gives you the knowledge to protect your investment.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 2: Manufacturer Warranty Comparison ===== */}
          <h2 style={S.h2}>Manufacturer Warranty Comparison Table (2026)</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Every major composite and PVC decking brand offers a different warranty structure. The differences are significant &mdash; a 25-year warranty and a 50-year warranty sound similar, but the coverage details vary dramatically. Here is a side-by-side breakdown:</p>

          </div>
          <p style={{ ...S.p, fontSize: '0.85rem', color: '#777' }}>Wood decking carries zero manufacturer warranty on the finished product. Lumber yards may offer limited rot warranties on treatment, but these rarely cover real-world performance issues.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 3: What Each Warranty Covers ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>What Each Warranty Type Actually Covers</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Deck warranties aren&apos;t one-size-fits-all. Understanding the different coverage categories prevents surprises when you need to make a claim.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Fade Resistance Warranty</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Covers color change beyond a specified Delta-E threshold. Trex warrants that boards won&apos;t fade more than a defined level over 25 years (50 years for Lineage). In practice, this means the boards will maintain their color within a range that most homeowners would consider normal aging. Virginia&apos;s UV exposure is moderate-to-high &mdash; we see roughly 1,800&ndash;2,000 hours of direct sunlight annually in Northern Virginia, and modern composite shells handle this well.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Stain Resistance Warranty</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Covers resistance to food, grease, and mold staining under normal residential use. This doesn&apos;t mean stains never occur &mdash; it means they should clean off with standard composite deck cleaner. Persistent staining that doesn&apos;t respond to approved cleaning methods is a valid warranty claim.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Structural Warranty</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Covers the decking board&apos;s structural integrity &mdash; cracking, splitting, splintering, rotting, or termite damage. This is the most straightforward coverage: if a board physically fails under normal use, the manufacturer replaces it. Note that structural failure caused by improper installation (wrong joist spacing, no end support) is typically excluded.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Workmanship Warranty (Installer)</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>This is separate from the manufacturer warranty and comes from your contractor. It covers defects in the installation itself &mdash; improper ledger attachment, flashing failures, inadequate drainage, loose railings, joist spacing errors, and structural settling. Our 2-year workmanship warranty covers 100% of labor and materials to correct any installation defect we caused. Many contractors offer only 1&ndash;2 years, and some offer nothing at all.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 4: What Voids a Warranty ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>What Voids a Deck Warranty</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>This is where most homeowners get burned. Manufacturer warranties have specific conditions that, if violated, void the entire warranty. We see these violations regularly on decks built by unlicensed contractors:</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>1. Improper Installation</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>The number-one warranty voider. If joist spacing exceeds 16&rdquo; on center (12&rdquo; for diagonal installations), if end boards lack support within 1&rdquo; of the end, or if gapping specifications aren&apos;t met, the warranty is void. Trex requires specific gapping (3/16&rdquo; side-to-side, 1/8&rdquo; end-to-end at 60&deg;F) that expands or contracts based on installation temperature. Getting this wrong is the most common mistake we see from inexperienced installers.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>2. No Building Permit</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Trex and TimberTech both require that decks be built in compliance with local building codes. In Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William counties, that means a valid building permit. If your deck was built without a permit, you have a potential warranty exposure &mdash; and a code compliance issue. See our <Link href="/deck-permit-loudoun-county-virginia" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>Loudoun County permit guide</Link> for the full process.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>3. Wrong Fasteners</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Each manufacturer specifies approved fastener systems. Trex recommends their proprietary hidden fastener clips or approved face screws. Using drywall screws, nails, or incompatible fastener brands can void coverage. We use exclusively manufacturer-approved fastener systems on every project.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>4. Improper Cleaning Methods</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Pressure washing above 3,100 PSI, using chlorine bleach, or applying unapproved chemical cleaners can damage the protective shell and void the stain/fade warranty. Trex recommends a maximum of 3,100 PSI at a 60-degree fan tip held 8+ inches from the surface. We recommend an even gentler approach: soft bristle brush with Trex-approved cleaner twice per year.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>5. Inadequate Ventilation</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Composite boards need airflow underneath to prevent moisture buildup. If your deck is too close to grade (under 6 inches of clearance for most brands), or if the underside is sealed without proper ventilation, moisture-related issues may not be covered. This is especially relevant in Northern Virginia&apos;s humid summers.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>6. Unauthorized Modifications</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Painting, staining, or coating composite decking voids the warranty. The surface shell is engineered to resist UV and moisture &mdash; adding a topcoat interferes with that system. We occasionally see homeowners paint their composite deck to change the color, not realizing they&apos;ve voided 25+ years of coverage.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 5: Why Installer Certification Matters ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Why Installer Certification Matters for Your Warranty</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>Not all installations activate the same warranty tier. Trex, in particular, ties warranty coverage directly to the installer&apos;s certification level:</p>

          <div style={{ overflowX: 'auto', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            <table style={{ width: '100%', borderCollapse: 'collapse', fontSize: '0.9rem' }}>

          </div>
          <p style={S.p}><strong>The critical distinction:</strong> When an unlicensed installer makes errors (wrong gapping, inadequate support, improper flashing), those errors void the manufacturer warranty. You still technically have a 25-year warranty, but the claim gets denied because the installation doesn&apos;t meet specifications. With a Trex Platinum partner like LDN Decks, the installation is guaranteed to meet every specification &mdash; and if it doesn&apos;t, our workmanship warranty covers the correction.</p>

          <p style={S.p}>If you notice an issue with your deck, here is the exact process to follow:</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Step 1: Identify the Issue Type</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Determine whether the issue is a <strong>product defect</strong> (fading, staining, cracking, splitting &mdash; manufacturer warranty) or an <strong>installation defect</strong> (loose boards, structural movement, water intrusion &mdash; workmanship warranty). This determines who you contact first.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Step 2: Document Everything</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Take clear photos in daylight showing the defect from multiple angles. Note the location on the deck, when you first noticed it, and any relevant conditions (recent storm, seasonal change). The more documentation you provide, the faster the claim processes.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Step 3: Contact the Right Party</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>For product defects, contact the manufacturer directly: Trex at 1-800-289-8739, TimberTech at 1-800-307-7780, or Fiberon at 1-800-573-8841. For installation defects, contact us at (571) 655-7207. If you&apos;re unsure which category applies, call us first &mdash; we&apos;ll help you determine the right path and can often facilitate manufacturer claims on your behalf.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Step 4: Provide Required Documentation</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Manufacturers will ask for: proof of purchase or installation contract, installation date, photos of the defect, your installer&apos;s name and certification level, and confirmation that the deck was built with permits. If we built your deck, we can provide all of this documentation from our records.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Step 5: Inspection and Resolution</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>The manufacturer may send an inspector or request additional photos. Approved claims typically result in replacement materials shipped to your address. As a Trex Platinum partner, our clients receive expedited claim processing &mdash; typically 2&ndash;4 weeks versus 6&ndash;8 weeks for standard claims.</p>

          <p style={S.p}><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> If a board fades excessively, that&apos;s a warranty claim. If a storm destroys your railing, that&apos;s an insurance claim. If your deck sags because the contractor skipped a footing, that&apos;s a workmanship warranty claim. Knowing which path to pursue saves weeks of back-and-forth.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 9: Common Warranty Mistakes in NoVA ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Common Warranty Mistakes We See in Northern Virginia</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>After building hundreds of decks in Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William counties, we&apos;ve seen recurring warranty issues that are entirely preventable:</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>No Permit = No Protection</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>We regularly inspect decks built without permits &mdash; especially in older Ashburn and Centreville neighborhoods. Beyond the code compliance risk, these homeowners discover at claim time that their warranty has a significant vulnerability. Every county in Northern Virginia requires a deck permit. There is no exception for &ldquo;small decks&rdquo; or &ldquo;replacement decks.&rdquo;</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Keeping Your Paperwork</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Store your installation contract, permit approval, product receipts, and any HOA approval letters together. Digital copies are fine. You may not need them for 10+ years, but when you do, having them readily available can mean the difference between an approved and denied claim.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>Maintenance Matters</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Composite decks are low-maintenance, not zero-maintenance. Trex recommends cleaning twice annually. Allowing organic debris to accumulate for years creates conditions (mold, staining) that may fall outside warranty coverage because they result from neglect rather than product failure. See our <Link href="/deck-maintenance-checklist-virginia" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>deck maintenance checklist</Link> for the recommended schedule.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 10: Warranty as Resale Value ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>How Warranty Coverage Affects Resale Value</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>In Northern Virginia&apos;s competitive real estate market, a transferable 25&ndash;50 year warranty is a genuine selling point. Buyers &mdash; especially in Brambleton, Broadlands, One Loudoun, and South Riding &mdash; specifically ask about deck warranties during home inspections.</p>
          <p style={S.p}>A Trex or TimberTech warranty that transfers to the new owner effectively makes the deck a worry-free asset for the buyer. Combined with the fact that composite decks recoup 65&ndash;80% of their cost at resale in Northern Virginia, warranty coverage amplifies ROI. Conversely, a wood deck with no warranty (and visible maintenance needs) can actually reduce perceived home value.</p>
          <p style={S.p}>We provide every client with a warranty package document that includes all manufacturer warranty certificates, our workmanship warranty, permit records, and maintenance guidelines &mdash; designed to be handed directly to a future buyer.</p>

          {/* ===== SECTION 11: Choosing Materials Based on Warranty ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Choosing Deck Materials Based on Warranty Protection</h2>
          <p style={S.p}>If warranty coverage is a top priority, here is how to think about material selection:</p>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem', lineHeight: 2 }}>
            <li><strong>Best warranty protection:</strong> TimberTech AZEK (50-year, full PVC, most comprehensive coverage)</li>
            <li><strong>Best warranty-to-cost ratio:</strong> Trex Transcend (25-year coverage at mid-range pricing, Platinum installer labor coverage)</li>
            <li><strong>Best budget option with warranty:</strong> Trex Enhance (same 25-year warranty as Transcend at 20&ndash;30% lower cost)</li>
            <li><strong>Best premium warranty:</strong> Trex Lineage (50-year warranty with ultra-realistic aesthetics)</li>
            <li><strong>No warranty protection:</strong> Pressure-treated wood, cedar, redwood (zero manufacturer coverage on the finished product)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          {[
            { q: "How long is the Trex decking warranty?", a: "Trex offers a 25-year limited residential warranty on Enhance and Transcend lines covering fade and stain resistance. The Trex Lineage line carries a 50-year warranty. All Trex warranties are transferable to subsequent homeowners." },
            { q: "What voids a composite deck warranty?", a: "Improper installation (wrong joist spacing, no gapping), non-approved fasteners, lack of building permits, harsh pressure washing above 3,100 PSI, chlorine bleach cleaning, painting or staining the surface, and inadequate ventilation underneath the deck." },
            { q: "Does a deck warranty cover labor costs?", a: "Most manufacturer warranties cover material replacement only. However, Trex Platinum partners like LDN Decks activate enhanced coverage that includes labor. Our separate 2-year workmanship warranty covers all installation-related issues at zero cost." },
            { q: "Is a deck warranty transferable when I sell my home?", a: "Yes. Trex requires notification within 60 days of transfer. TimberTech/AZEK warranties transfer automatically. This transferability adds real resale value — buyers in Northern Virginia specifically ask about deck warranty status." },
            { q: "What does a workmanship warranty cover?", a: "Installation defects: ledger board attachment, flashing, joist spacing, railing post connections, stair stringer separation, fastener failure, and structural settling. Our 2-year warranty covers 100% of labor and materials to correct any defect." },
            { q: "How do I file a Trex warranty claim?", a: "Contact Trex at 1-800-289-8739 or file at trex.com/warranty. Have your proof of purchase, installation date, photos, and installer information ready. Claims through Trex Platinum partners like us receive expedited processing (2-4 weeks vs 6-8 weeks)." },
