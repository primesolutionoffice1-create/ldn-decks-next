          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Arlington County&apos;s compact urban lots and proximity to Washington DC create unique challenges and opportunities for outdoor living projects. Many Arlington homes have smaller backyards that benefit from multi-level deck designs that maximize vertical space, or low-profile ground-level decks that create the illusion of a larger yard.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Arlington also has historic preservation overlay districts in neighborhoods like Maywood, Cherrydale, and parts of Lyon Village where exterior modifications must comply with additional architectural review requirements. Our team has experience navigating these requirements and designing decks that respect the neighborhood&apos;s character while delivering modern outdoor living functionality.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Building permits in Arlington County typically take 3–4 weeks for review. We handle the entire process — structural drawings, site plans, and inspection coordination — so you never visit the county office.</p>
