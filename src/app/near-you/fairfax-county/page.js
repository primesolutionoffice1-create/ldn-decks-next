          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>Why Fairfax County Homeowners Trust LDN Decks</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Fairfax County is the most populous county in Virginia with over 1.1 million residents and median home values exceeding $650,000. The county&apos;s established neighborhoods — from Vienna and McLean to Burke and Springfield — represent decades of homeownership, and many properties are now due for outdoor living upgrades as original decks reach the end of their lifespan.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>LDN Decks brings <strong>Trex Platinum Partner</strong> and <strong>TimberTech Certified Installer</strong> expertise to every Fairfax County project. We understand the county&apos;s detailed building code requirements, HOA architectural review processes, and the high standards Fairfax homeowners expect.</p>

          <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', fontWeight: 600, margin: '2rem 0 1rem' }}>Fairfax County Building Permits & Codes</h3>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Fairfax County requires building permits for all attached decks and any deck over 200 square feet. Applications are submitted through the <strong>FIDO online system</strong> (Fairfax Inspections Database Online). Processing time is <strong>3-6 weeks</strong> — longer than Loudoun or Prince William counties. Three inspections required: footing, framing, final.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>LDN Decks handles the <strong>entire Fairfax County permit process</strong> including structural drawings, FIDO submission, and inspector coordination. We build to exceed Fairfax County&apos;s typical deck detail specifications and maintain a <strong>100% permit approval rate</strong>.</p>
