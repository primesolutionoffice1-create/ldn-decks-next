          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.8rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>Why Loudoun County Homeowners Choose LDN Decks</h2>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Loudoun County is one of the wealthiest and fastest-growing counties in the United States, with median home values exceeding $700,000. Homeowners here demand premium outdoor living spaces that match the quality of their homes — and they expect contractors who understand the unique requirements of building in Loudoun.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>LDN Decks is based in the heart of Northern Virginia and has completed <strong>200+ custom deck projects</strong> across Loudoun County communities including Ashburn, Leesburg, Sterling, Brambleton, Broadlands, South Riding, Stone Ridge, Purcellville, and Aldie. We are a <strong>Trex Platinum Partner</strong> (highest certification tier) and <strong>TimberTech Certified Installer</strong>, meaning we install the best composite decking materials available with manufacturer-backed warranties up to 50 years.</p>

          <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', fontWeight: 600, margin: '2rem 0 1rem' }}>Navigating Loudoun County HOA Requirements</h3>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Over 80% of Loudoun County homes are in HOA-governed communities. Architectural Review Board (ARB) approval is required before any exterior modification — including decks, porches, patios, fences, and pergolas. Each community has different material restrictions, color requirements, setback rules, and height limits.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>We have extensive experience submitting compliant proposals to Loudoun County HOAs including <strong>Brambleton Community Association</strong>, <strong>Broadlands HOA</strong>, <strong>Ashburn Village Corporation</strong>, <strong>Lansdowne on the Potomac</strong>, <strong>Stone Ridge Association</strong>, and <strong>South Riding Proprietary</strong>. Our approval rate is <strong>100%</strong> — we design specifically to your community&apos;s requirements so revisions are rare.</p>

          <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', fontWeight: 600, margin: '2rem 0 1rem' }}>Loudoun County Building Permits</h3>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>All decks attached to a home or more than 30 inches above grade require a building permit from Loudoun County Department of Building and Development. The permit process typically takes <strong>10-15 business days</strong> for review. Three inspections are required: footings, framing, and final.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>LDN Decks handles the <strong>entire permit process</strong> — from preparing structural drawings to coordinating with county inspectors. This is included as part of every project at no additional charge. We are fully familiar with Loudoun County&apos;s residential deck detail requirements and build to exceed code minimums.</p>

          <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', fontWeight: 600, margin: '2rem 0 1rem' }}>Deck Cost in Loudoun County (2026 Pricing)</h3>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Loudoun County deck prices run <strong>25-35% above the Virginia state average</strong> due to higher labor rates, stricter building codes, and HOA requirements. Here are typical project ranges for Loudoun homeowners:</p>

          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Ashburn & Brambleton:</strong> Multi-level composite Trex and TimberTech decks with integrated screened porches. Homes in Brambleton, Broadlands, and Ashburn Village are reaching the age where original pressure-treated wood decks need replacement — composite upgrades are the most requested service.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Leesburg:</strong> Front porch additions on historic in-town homes, screened porch construction on newer colonials, and estate-lot outdoor living packages combining deck + patio + fire feature.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Sterling & Cascades:</strong> Deck resurfacing for aging subdivisions, ground-level patios with pavers, and privacy fence installations to complement deck projects.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}><strong>Purcellville & Western Loudoun:</strong> Large custom decks on estate properties with scenic views, pergola installations, and outdoor kitchen builds that take advantage of the rural landscape.</p>

          <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', fontWeight: 600, margin: '2rem 0 1rem' }}>Virginia Climate Considerations for Loudoun County Decks</h3>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Loudoun County experiences <strong>50-80 freeze-thaw cycles per winter</strong>, humid summers with 70-90% humidity, and 200+ sunny days per year. This combination is exceptionally hard on wood decking — pressure-treated boards can crack, warp, and gray within 2-3 years without annual maintenance.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>We recommend <strong>capped composite decking</strong> (Trex Transcend or TimberTech AZEK) for Loudoun County homes. The polymer cap prevents moisture penetration, resists UV fading, and requires zero staining or sealing — just wash with soap and water once or twice per year. Manufacturer warranties cover 25-50 years of performance.</p>
