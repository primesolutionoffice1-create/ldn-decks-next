          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Stafford County is one of the fastest-growing counties in Virginia, with new construction communities expanding rapidly along the I-95 corridor. Many of these homes feature walkout basements and sloped lots that are ideal for elevated and multi-level deck designs.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>The Stafford County building permit process is the most straightforward in our service area, with typical review times of just 2–3 weeks. We handle all documentation, submission, and inspection coordination as part of your project.</p>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>Stafford&apos;s larger lot sizes and fewer HOA restrictions (compared to Loudoun and Fairfax) give homeowners more design freedom. We take full advantage of this to build larger, more creative outdoor living spaces — including deck and patio combinations, freestanding pergolas, and outdoor kitchens.</p>
