  {
    q: "How much does a screened porch cost in Northern Virginia?",
    a: "A custom screened porch in Northern Virginia typically starts around $25,000 and can range up to $60,000+, depending on size, roof tie-in complexity, flooring material (composite vs. wood), and upgrades like EZE-Breeze windows or outdoor fireplaces."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a permit to build a screened porch in VA?",
    a: "Yes. Screened porches require structural plans, roof framing details, and county permits (Loudoun, Fairfax, or Prince William). We handle the entire architectural and permitting process for you."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build a screened porch over an existing deck?",
    a: "In some cases, yes, if the existing deck footings and structure were originally engineered to support a roof load. However, most standard decks cannot safely support a roof without significant retrofitting or a complete rebuild of the foundation."
  },
  {
    q: "What are EZE-Breeze windows?",
    a: "EZE-Breeze is a sliding panel system made of durable vinyl that looks like glass. It allows you to convert your screened porch into a 3-season room, blocking pollen, rain, and cold wind while opening completely on nice days."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to build a screened porch?",
    a: "Permitting typically takes 3-6 weeks due to the structural review. Once construction begins, a standard screened porch takes about 3-5 weeks to complete, factoring in framing, roofing, electrical, and finishing."
