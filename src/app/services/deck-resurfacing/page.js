      "The TimberTech Vintage Collection is the gold standard of composite decking in the industry. While many homeowners are familiar with standard composite boards, Vintage stands apart by utilizing an Advanced PVC material core that contains zero wood fibers. This makes it a superior option compared to traditional [new deck construction](/services/new-decks) materials.",
      "This 100% synthetic composition makes it effectively immune to the moisture, swelling, mold, and rot that slowly degrades traditional wood-composite blends in Northern Virginia’s humid climate. Its proprietary capping technology resists fading and staining, ensuring your deck looks as vibrant in year 20 as it did on day one."

  { title: "Step 1: Structural Integrity Inspection", desc: "Before we ever lay a new board, we rigorously inspect your existing ledger board, joists, and concrete footings. If the sub-structure is rotting, we cannot resurface it. Safety is always our primary directive." },
  { title: "Step 2: Permit Acquisition", desc: "If modifications to the railing system or structural reinforcements are needed, we handle all Loudoun County building permits required to ensure total code compliance." },
  { title: "Step 3: Strategic Demolition", desc: "We carefully remove and haul away your old, warped surface boards and railing systems without damaging the foundational joist structure beneath." },
  { title: "Step 4: Joist Protection & Reinforcement", desc: "We apply heavy-duty butyl joist tape over the top of your existing wood framing. This crucial barrier prevents future water intrusion and dramatically extends the life of your wood." },
  { title: "Step 5: Surface & Railing Installation", desc: "We install your new TimberTech Vintage boards using hidden fastening systems for a clean, screw-free surface. We then install upgraded railings (such as Trex Signature Aluminum or glass panels)." },

const resurfacingFAQs = [
  { 
    question: "How do I know if my deck is a candidate for resurfacing?", 
    answer: "A deck is typically a good candidate if the foundational posts, beams, and joists are sturdy, free of deep rot, and built to modern safety codes. During our free evaluation, we structurally probe the wood. If your frame is over 25 years old or severely compromised by water damage, a full replacement will be necessary." 
  },
  { 
    question: "How much does deck resurfacing cost compared to building a new deck?", 
    answer: "On average, resurfacing your deck with premium composite material costs 25-40% less than building a brand new deck of the same size, primarily because you are saving significantly on foundational lumber and structural labor." 
  },
  { 
    question: "Do I need a building permit to resurface my deck in Virginia?", 
    answer: "If you are strictly replacing the surface decking boards (the 'skin') on a one-for-one basis, many jurisdictions consider it a repair that does not require a permit. However, if the project involves altering the structural framing, changing the stairs, or installing a new railing system, a permit is almost always required. We navigate this entirely for you." 
  },
  { 
    question: "Can I change the layout or size of my deck during resurfacing?", 
    answer: "Usually, yes. While the main body of the deck remains the same, we can often frame out extensions, widen stairs, or add specialized bumps-outs for a grill station while utilizing the main existing structure."
