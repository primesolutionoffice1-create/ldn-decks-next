      "In Northern Virginia, the combination of intense spring pollen, humid summers, and freeze-thaw winter cycles creates the perfect breeding ground for organic growth on outdoor surfaces. Allowed to fester, mold, mildew, and algae will root deep into the pores of your wood or composite decking.",
      "Beyond looking unsightly, this organic buildup becomes incredibly slippery and dangerous when wet. More importantly, mold feeds on the organic fibers of wood decks, accelerating rot and structurally compromising your investment. Professional washing is not just a cosmetic upgrade; it is critical preventative maintenance."

    paragraphs: [
      "The most common mistake homeowners make is renting a 3000 PSI pressure washer and blasting their pressure-treated wood or Trex boards at point-blank range.",
      "High pressure water acts like a liquid buzzsaw. On natural wood, it will 'fur' the boards by shredding the cellulose fibers, leading to massive splintering. On composite decks, excessive pressure will strip the protective acrylic capping, voiding the manufacturer's warranty entirely. We utilize specialized 'Soft Washing' techniques that rely on premium detergents and high water volume, not high pressure, to safely lift dirt."

const deckWashingFAQs = [
  {
    q: "How often should I have my deck washed in Virginia?",
    a: "We recommend a professional cleaning at least once every 12 to 18 months, typically scheduled in the late spring after the heavy oak and pine pollen drop has settled."
  },
  {
    q: "Will the cleaning chemicals harm my landscaping or pets?",
    a: "We employ extensive property protection measures. We pre-wet and post-wet all surrounding grass and shrubs. The detergents we use are heavily diluted and break down quickly into harmless salts when flushed with water. It is completely safe for pets once the deck has dried."
  },
  {
    q: "Do composite decks really need to be washed?",
    a: "Yes. While composite decks (like Trex) are highly resistant to moisture, the dirt and pollen that settle on top of them can still grow mold. A bi-annual soft wash keeps them looking brand new and fulfills the maintenance requirements of the manufacturer warranty."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you also apply stain and sealant after washing?",
    a: "Yes, once the organic wood has been thoroughly cleaned, neutralized, and allowed to dry to a proper moisture content level (usually 24-48 hours later depending on sun exposure), we can return to apply premium contractor-grade sealants."
