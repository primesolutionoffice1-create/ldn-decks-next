    paragraphs: [
      "Your front door is the focal point of your property's exterior. It is the first thing guests interact with, the primary barrier for your home's security, and a critical component in your home's energy efficiency. In Northern Virginia's climate, a poorly insulated or warped entry door can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost HVAC efficiency every year.",
      "Loudoun Decks provides premium entry door installation services. We don't just hang a door on old hinges; we execute a full-frame replacement. This ensures your new door is perfectly plumb, heavily insulated, and visually stunning, instantly elevating your curb appeal."

    listItems: [
      { label: "Fiberglass Doors", text: "The most popular choice today. Fiberglass won't warp, rot, or rust. It can be manufactured to perfectly mimic the grain of real mahogany or oak, but requires a fraction of the maintenance." },

    title: "The Importance of Full-Frame Replacement",
    paragraphs: [
      "Many big-box store contractors offer 'slab replacement'—simply ripping the old door off the hinges and screwing a new one in the existing frame. This is a massive mistake if you want true performance.",
      "At Loudoun Decks, we emphasize full-frame replacement. We remove the entire door unit down to the rough opening studs. This allows us to assess and repair any hidden water rot in the sill, install brand new threshold flashing, and shoot low-expansion foam insulation entirely around the new frame to guarantee a perfect seal."

    listItems: [
      { label: "Rot Repair", text: "We fix the underlying structural damage that previous leaky doors left behind." },
      { label: "Flashing & Sealing", text: "We employ architectural-grade flashing tape and caulk to ensure water never penetrates the subfloor." },

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How long does a professional door installation take?",
    a: "Assuming no severe structural rot is found in the frame, a standard full-frame entry door replacement typically takes our crew one full day to complete, including interior trim finishing and cleanup."
  },
  {
    q: "Are fiberglass doors better than wood?",
    a: "In terms of longevity and maintenance, yes. Fiberglass is highly resistant to Maryland and Virginia's humid summers and freezing winters. It will not warp, swell, or rot like wood, yet it provides the exact same visual aesthetic when properly stained or painted."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you expand my doorway to add sidelites?",
    a: "Yes. Expanding a standard single door into a grand entryway with a double door or sidelites involves significant structural reframing (installing a wider header). Our heavy-carpentry teams are fully equipped to handle this structural modification safely."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you install smart locks and hardware?",
    a: "Yes. You can supply your own smart lock or keypad deadbolt, and our technicians will professionally bore the door and install the electronic hardware during the door's final installation."
