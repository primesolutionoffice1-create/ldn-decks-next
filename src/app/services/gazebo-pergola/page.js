      "When planning to add vertical architecture to your backyard, the terms 'pergola' and 'gazebo' are often used interchangeably, but they serve very different functional purposes.",
      "A pergola is an outdoor structure featuring an open-beam roof supported by vertical columns or pillars. Its primary purpose isn't to block out the rain, but rather to diffuse harsh sunlight, provide a framework for climbing vines, and create a gorgeous architectural transition space. Conversely, a gazebo acts as an outdoor room. It features a fully closed, pitched roof (often shingled to match your house) and provides total shelter from the elements, allowing you to enjoy your backyard even during summer downpours."

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is the main difference between a gazebo and a pergola?",
    a: "A gazebo typically has a completely solid, pitched roof and provides full shade and rain protection, while a pergola has an open-beam or slatted roof design that provides partial shade and allows air to flow directly upward."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a building permit for these structures in Loudoun County?",
    a: "Yes. Almost all permanent vertical structures like gazebos and pergolas require a residential building permit, particularly because they must adhere to setbacks and wind-load engineering requirements. Loudoun Decks handles 100% of the permit process for you."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build a pergola on top of my existing deck?",
    a: "Yes, but it depends on the foundational framing. Pergolas are heavy. We must first evaluate your deck's joists and footings to ensure they can support the additional structural load and resist wind uplift before proceeding."
  },
  {
    q: "How much maintenance does a wood pergola require?",
    a: "If built with Cedar or Redwood, natural wood pergolas require staining or sealing every 2 to 3 years to maintain their rich color and prevent greying. If you prefer zero maintenance, we highly recommend our vinyl, fiberglass, or heavy-gauge aluminum options."
