    { "@type": "Question", name: "Is Trex Transcend worth the extra cost over Enhance?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "For most homeowners, yes. Transcend's deeper wood grain, thicker shell, and richer color palette justify the 25-35% premium over Enhance. If budget is tight, Enhance Naturals is a strong alternative same warranty, slightly less visual depth." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Does Trex Transcend fade?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "All composite decking experiences minor initial color settling in the first 60-90 days as the UV stabilizers activate. After that, Transcend holds its color exceptionally well. After 5+ years on our earliest Northern Virginia installs, fade is minimal and even not patchy." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How hot does Trex Transcend get in the sun?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Darker Transcend colors (Lava Rock, Spiced Rum) can reach 130-150°F in direct Virginia summer sun. Lighter colors (Island Mist, Rope Swing) stay 15-20 degrees cooler. For pool decks and barefoot areas, we recommend lighter colors or TimberTech AZEK which runs slightly cooler." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How long does Trex Transcend last?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Trex warranties Transcend for 25 years against structural damage, fade, and stain. Real-world lifespan is 30-40+ years with basic maintenance (occasional soap and water wash). Our earliest Transcend installs in Loudoun County (2019) still look excellent." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "What is the difference between Trex Transcend and Lineage?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Lineage is Trex's newest premium line with a more realistic wood grain pattern and a 50-year warranty (vs 25 for Transcend). Lineage costs 10-15% more than Transcend. Both use the same shell technology. Lineage is worth it if you want the absolute most realistic wood look in composite." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How much does a Trex Transcend deck cost in Northern Virginia?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Trex Transcend costs $45-$65 per square foot installed in Northern Virginia.

          <p>Trex Transcend is the <strong>best value in premium composite decking</strong> for Northern Virginia homes. It delivers near-hardwood aesthetics, proven 5+ year performance in Virginia&apos;s climate, and a 25-year warranty at 15–25% less than TimberTech AZEK. The only knock: dark colors get hot in direct summer sun. For most homeowners, Transcend is the sweet spot between Enhance (budget) and Lineage/AZEK (ultra-premium).</p>

          <p style={S.p}>Most Trex Transcend reviews are written by people who&apos;ve never installed a board. We&apos;re a <strong>Trex Platinum Partner</strong> a designation held by fewer than 1% of deck builders in the United States and we&apos;ve installed Trex Transcend on over 500 projects across Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William counties since 2019. This review is based on real-world performance data, not manufacturer specs.</p>
          <p style={S.p}>We also install TimberTech, AZEK, and Fiberon, so we have direct comparison experience across brands. We have no financial incentive to recommend one brand over another we install whatever is right for the project.</p>

          {/* ===== What We Like ===== */}
          <h2 style={S.h2}>What We Like About Trex Transcend</h2>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>1. The Wood Grain Is Genuinely Convincing</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Transcend boards feature a deep, multi-tonal grain pattern that photographs beautifully and looks natural at normal viewing distance. The Havana Gold and Spiced Rum colors, in particular, have a warmth that pairs perfectly with the red brick and stone colonial architecture that dominates Loudoun and Fairfax counties. Compared to the earlier Trex Select (now discontinued) or even the current Enhance line, Transcend is a significant step up in realism.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>2. The Shell Protection Actually Works</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Trex&apos;s three-sided shell technology wraps the board&apos;s top and sides in a protective polymer cap. After 5+ years on our earliest Northern Virginia installs, we&apos;ve seen zero cap delamination, zero mold penetration through the cap, and no structural degradation. Virginia&apos;s freeze-thaw cycles (30+ per winter), summer humidity, and intense UV don&apos;t faze this product. The shell does what Trex says it does.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>3. The Color Palette Is Designed for Mid-Atlantic Architecture</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Transcend offers 8 colors across two sub-collections. Our most-installed colors in Northern Virginia:</p>
          <div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', gap: '1rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            {[
              { color: 'Havana Gold', desc: 'Warm medium brown. Our #1 seller. Complements brick, stone, and painted siding equally well.', pct: '35%' },
              { color: 'Spiced Rum', desc: 'Rich reddish-brown. Popular in McLean, Great Falls, and Vienna where homes lean traditional.', pct: '25%' },
              { color: 'Island Mist', desc: 'Cool medium gray. Clean, contemporary look. Stays cooler in direct sun than browns.', pct: '20%' },
              { color: 'Lava Rock', desc: 'Deep charcoal brown. Dramatic and modern. Gets hottest in sun best for shaded decks.', pct: '10%' },
            ].map((c) => (
              <div key={c.color} style={{ background: '#f9f9f9', borderRadius: 8, padding: '1.25rem' }}>
                <h4 style={{ fontWeight: 600, marginBottom: '0.25rem' }}>{c.color} <span style={{ fontWeight: 400, color: '#999', fontSize: '0.85rem' }}>({c.pct} of our installs)</span></h4>
                <p style={{ fontSize: '0.9rem', color: '#555', lineHeight: 1.5, margin: 0 }}>{c.desc}</p>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>4. Installation Is Consistent and Predictable</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>From a contractor&apos;s perspective, Transcend boards are dimensionally stable, cut cleanly with standard carbide-tipped blades, and the hidden fastener system (Trex Hideaway) seats reliably. Board-to-board color consistency is excellent within a lot. We rarely encounter warped or defective boards Trex&apos;s quality control is among the best in the industry.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>5. The Price-to-Performance Ratio Is Unmatched</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>At <Link href="/composite-deck-cost-northern-virginia" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>$45–$65 per square foot installed</Link> in Northern Virginia, Transcend delivers 90% of the aesthetics and 100% of the durability of products costing 15–25% more (TimberTech AZEK, Trex Lineage). For homeowners who want premium without ultra-premium pricing, it&apos;s the mathematical sweet spot.</p>

          {/* ===== What We Don't Like ===== */}
          <h2 style={{ ...S.h2, marginTop: '2.5rem' }}>What We Don&apos;t Like About Trex Transcend</h2>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>1. Dark Colors Get Hot Really Hot</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>This is the single most common complaint we hear from homeowners after installation. In direct Virginia summer sun (June–August), dark Transcend colors like Lava Rock and Spiced Rum can reach <strong>130–150&deg;F</strong> surface temperature. That&apos;s too hot for bare feet. Lighter colors (Island Mist, Rope Swing) are noticeably cooler typically 15–20 degrees lower.</p>
          <p style={S.p}><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> If your deck gets full afternoon sun and your family goes barefoot, choose Island Mist or Rope Swing. For pool decks, consider <Link href="/trex-vs-timbertech-vs-azek" style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)', fontWeight: 600 }}>TimberTech AZEK</Link> which runs slightly cooler due to its full PVC construction.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>2. Light Scratches From Furniture</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Dragging heavy metal furniture across Transcend can leave light scuff marks on the shell surface. These are cosmetic only they don&apos;t penetrate the protective cap and they tend to blend into the grain pattern over a few months of UV exposure. But it&apos;s worth knowing upfront. Use furniture pads on chair and table legs.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>3. The 25-Year Warranty Is Good, Not Great</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Trex Transcend carries a 25-year fade and stain warranty plus a lifetime limited structural warranty. This is solid but Trex Lineage and TimberTech AZEK now offer 50-year warranties. If you plan to stay in your home for 25+ years or want maximum future-proofing, the 50-year warranty products are worth the 10–15% premium.</p>

          <h3 style={S.h3}>4. It&apos;s Not Immune to Mold ON the Surface</h3>
          <p style={S.p}>Trex&apos;s shell prevents mold from growing <em>inside</em> the board, but organic matter (pollen, leaf debris, dirt) that sits on the surface can develop surface mold in Virginia&apos;s humid climate. This is easily solved with a biannual soap-and-water scrub. It&apos;s not a product defect it happens on every composite brand but homeowners who expect literally zero maintenance may be disappointed.</p>

          {[
            { q: "Is Trex Transcend worth the extra cost over Enhance?", a: "For most homeowners, yes. Transcend's deeper wood grain, thicker shell, and richer color palette justify the 25-35% premium. If budget is tight, Enhance Naturals is a strong alternative." },
            { q: "Does Trex Transcend fade?", a: "Minor initial color settling in the first 60-90 days. After that, it holds its color beautifully. Our earliest installs (2019) show minimal, even fade." },
            { q: "How hot does Trex Transcend get in the sun?", a: "Dark colors reach 130-150°F in direct Virginia summer sun. Lighter colors (Island Mist, Rope Swing) stay 15-20 degrees cooler. For pool decks, consider AZEK." },
            { q: "How long does Trex Transcend last?", a: "25-year warranty. Real-world lifespan is 30-40+ years. Our earliest Northern Virginia installs (2019) still look excellent." },
            { q: "What's the difference between Transcend and Lineage?", a: "Lineage has a more realistic wood grain and a 50-year warranty. Costs 10-15% more. Both use the same shell technology." },
            { q: "How much does a Trex Transcend deck cost?", a: "$45-$65 per square foot installed. 300 sqft deck: $22,000-$30,000. 500 sqft: $35,000-$48,000." },
